This phylogeny shows evolutionary relationships of hCoV-19 (or SARS-CoV-2) viruses from the ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic with a particular focus on Belgium. In addition, we include virus genomes from other European countries and to lesser extent from the rest of the world to provide phylogenetic context. This context is important to understand how different outbreaks are connected and how the virus might have spread around the globe. We note, however, that direct linkage on the tree does not necessarily mean there exists a direct epidemiological link. Sampling of viral genomes is very incomplete and heterogeneous and mutations occur on average only every two weeks. Extended periods without mutations are therefore not uncommon and direct links or directionality cannot be inferred from the tree alone.

Sequence data and postal code (or zip code) information for the Belgian sequences have been made available in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This leads to three important phenomena: 1. of all the SARS-CoV-2 sequences generated within Belgium (estimated at over 4,000), less than half have been cleared to be made publicly available; 2.  postal codes could not be released for all available sequences and are hence assigned the postal code of the sequencing center (e.g. postal code 9000 for Ghent, despite the patients not residing in that postal code; 3. three N501Y,69-70 variants have been sequenced so far in Belgium (and their presence has been reported in media reports) but the sequences cannot be made publicly available.

All data we use (European and international) are deposited in [GISAID](https://www.gisaid.org/). We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequence and metadata made available through GISAID on which this research is based. A full listing of all originating and submitting laboratories is available below.
